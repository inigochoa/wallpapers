# New pull request

- [ ] I've read [how to submit a wallpaper]
  - [ ] At least 3200Ã—1800px.
  - [ ] No text or logos.
  - [ ] No people.
  - [ ] Not too distracting if a non-maximized window is open.
- [ ] I've updated `LICENSE.md` with:
  - [ ] The name of the wallpaper and/or its original author.
  - [ ] A link to where it can be downloaded.
  - [ ] Included under the respective license section (or created a new one if
  appropriate).
- [ ] I've added the artist metadata using `exiftool`.
